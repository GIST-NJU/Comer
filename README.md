## COMER, an enhancement approach of CT which supports metamorphic relation matching

We mainly explored 31 software subjects. For each of these software subjects, we provide a folder containing  the abstract phase code and the concrete phase code. Specifically, it includesï¼š

1)the source code. 

2) we use mutation testing on the correct software subjects, which results in additional faulty software subjects. 

3)the scripts that can map an abstract test input into a concrete and executable test case. 

4)the scripts that can search and count the matchings of the metamorphic relations between generated test cases. 

5) all the abstract test cases and all the concrete test cases.

It also includes the results of our emprical studies of COMER, that is, subjects.xlsx.
